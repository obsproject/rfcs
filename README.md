# OBS Project RFCs

[OBS Project RFCs]: #obs-project-rfcs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements, can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the OBS Project
community.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for new features, functionality, and changes to undergo
a peer-review and allow all interested parties to weigh in their comments
and ensure the direction is consistent with the vision of the project.

## When you need to follow this process
[When you need to follow this process]: #when-you-need-to-follow-this-process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial" changes to
OBS Studio, obs-browser, or any of the other plugins/modules. What constitutes a
"substantial" change is evolving based on community norms and varies depending
on what part of the ecosystem you are proposing to change, but may include the
following.

  - Entirely new features/functionality that are not currently available
  - Major changes to existing features, or requests to redesign those features
  - Changes to the internal engineering design of any part of the program
  - Things that drastically change the end-user experience, both from a
    workflow and UX perspective.
  - Changes to API, ABI, or settings storage format of the program

Some changes do not require an RFC:

  - Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise "changing shape does
    not change meaning".
  - Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria
    (warning removal, speedup, better platform coverage, more parallelism, trap
    more errors, etc.)
  - Additions only likely to be _noticed by_ other developers, and are
    invisible to end users.
  - rtmp-service updates

If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through
the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first.
If you are unsure if your change requires an RFC, just ask!

## Before creating an RFC
[Before creating an RFC]: #before-creating-an-rfc

A hastily-proposed RFC can hurt its chances of acceptance. Low quality
proposals, proposals for previously-rejected features, or those that don't fit
into the projects near or long-term goals, may be quickly rejected, which can
be demotivating for the unprepared contributor. Laying some groundwork ahead of
the RFC can make the process smoother.

Although there is no single way to prepare for submitting an RFC, it is
generally a good idea to pursue feedback from other project developers
beforehand, to ascertain that the RFC may be desirable; having a consistent
impact on the project requires concerted effort toward consensus-building.

The most common preparations for writing and submitting an RFC include talking
the idea over on our [official Discord server], or discussing the topic on our
[developer discussion forum].

As a rule of thumb, receiving encouraging feedback from long-standing project
developers is a good indication that the RFC is worth pursuing.


## What the process is
[What the process is]: #what-the-process-is

In short, to get a major feature added to OBS, one must first get the RFC
merged into the RFC repository as a markdown file. At that point, the RFC is
"active" and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into OBS.
It is recommended that no work start on implementation until an RFC is accepted.

  - Fork the RFC repo [RFC repository]
  - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md`. Make sure the title
    is descriptive. RFC number should match the next PR number.
  - Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present
    convincing motivation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of the design's
    impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to
    be poorly-received.
  - Submit a pull request to the [RFC repository]. As a pull request the RFC
    will receive design feedback from the larger community, and the author
	should be prepared to revise it in response.
  - Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are
    much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
    comments. Feel free to reach out to the project developers to get
    help identifying issues and obstacles.
  - The project team will discuss the RFC pull request, as much as possible in the
    comment thread of the pull request itself. Offline discussion will be
    summarized on the pull request comment thread.
  - RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives
    and drawbacks are shown. You can make edits, big and small, to the RFC to
    clarify or change the design, but make changes as new commits to the pull
    request, and leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes.
    Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they are visible on the
    pull request.
  - At some point, a member of the team will propose a "motion for final
    comment period" (FCP), along with a *disposition* for the RFC (merge, close,
    or postpone).
    - This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that
    the team is in a position to make a decision. That does not require
    consensus amongst all participants in the RFC thread (which is usually
    impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on the RFC
    needs to have already been clearly articulated, and there should not be a
    strong consensus *against* that position outside of the team. Team
    members use their best judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself
    ensures there is ample time and notification for interested parties to push
    back if it is made prematurely.
    - For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP is usually preceded by
      a *summary comment* trying to lay out the current state of the discussion
      and major tradeoffs/points of disagreement.
  - The FCP lasts ten calendar days so that it is open for at least 5 business
    days. This way all parties have a chance to lodge any final objections
    before a decision is reached.
  - In most cases, the FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or
    closed. However, sometimes substantial new arguments or ideas are raised,
    the FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.

## The RFC life-cycle
[The RFC life-cycle]: #the-rfc-life-cycle

Once an RFC becomes "active" then authors may implement it and submit the
feature as a pull request to the OBS Project (or appropriate module) repo. Being
"active" is not a rubber stamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature
will ultimately be merged; it does mean that in principle all the major interested
parties have agreed to the feature and are amenable to merging it.

Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is "active"
implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its implementation, nor does
it imply anything about whether an OBS Project developer has been assigned the
task of implementing the feature. While it is not *necessary* that the author
of the RFC also write the implementation, it is by far the most effective way
to see an RFC through to completion: authors should not expect that other project
developers will take on responsibility for implementing their accepted feature.

Modifications to "active" RFCs can be done in follow-up pull requests. We
strive to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of
the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every
merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the
next major release.

In general, once accepted, RFCs should not be substantially changed. Only very
minor changes should be submitted as amendments. More substantial changes
should be new RFCs, with a note added to the original RFC. Exactly what counts
as a "very minor change" is up to the core team to decide.


## Reviewing RFCs
[Reviewing RFCs]: #reviewing-rfcs

While the RFC pull request is up, the team may reach out to the author to
discuss the issues in greater detail, and in some cases, the topic may be
discussed at an internal team meeting. In either case, a summary from the
resulting discussions will be posted back to the RFC pull request.

The core team makes final decisions about RFCs after the benefits and drawbacks
are well understood. These decisions can be made at any time, but the team
will regularly issue decisions. When a decision is made, the RFC pull request
will either be merged or closed. In either case, if the reasoning is not clear
from the discussion in the thread, the team will add a comment describing the
rationale for the decision.


## Implementing an RFC
[Implementing an RFC]: #implementing-an-rfc

Some accepted RFCs represent vital features that need to be implemented right
away. Other accepted RFCs can represent features that can wait until some
arbitrary developer feels like doing the work. Every accepted RFC has an
associated issue tracking its implementation in the relevant OBS Project
repository; thus that associated issue can be assigned a priority via the
triage process that the team uses for all issues in the relevant repository.

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC
author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for
review after the RFC has been accepted.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an "active" RFC, but
cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask
(e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue or asking in the
[official Discord server]).


## RFC Postponement
[RFC Postponement]: #rfc-postponement

Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the "postponed" label when they are
closed (as part of the rejection process). An RFC closed with "postponed" is
marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal
nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and
we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so. Postponed pull
requests may be re-opened when the time is right. There is no formal process
for when a postponed RFC is reopened. We recommend asking us directly about
any postponed RFCs in our [official Discord Server].

Usually, an RFC pull request marked as "postponed" has already passed an
informal first round of evaluation, namely the round of "do we think we would
ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull request,
or some semi-obvious variation of it." (When the answer to the latter question
is "no", then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, not postpone it.)


### Help this is all too informal!
[Help this is all too informal!]: #help-this-is-all-too-informal

The process is intended to be as lightweight as reasonable for the present
circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by
consensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.
